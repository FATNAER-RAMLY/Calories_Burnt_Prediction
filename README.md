## Description 
This project aims to predict the number of calories burned during physical activities based on collected individual data. The main steps include data collection and preparation, exploratory analysis, visualization, and modeling using the **XGBoost Regressor**. This project serves as a great demonstration of data science and machine learning skills.

### Main Steps:
1. Import necessary libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.).
2. Data collection and preprocessing to ensure quality.
3. Exploratory analysis to identify relationships between variables.
4. Data visualization for better understanding.
5. Build a regression model using XGBoost to make predictions.
6. Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd calories-burnt-prediction
   ```
3. Open the notebook file `Project_16_Calories_Burnt_Prediction.ipynb` and execute the cells step by step.

## Results
The model predicts the number of calories burned based on the input features. The performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE and MAE to ensure accurate predictions.
